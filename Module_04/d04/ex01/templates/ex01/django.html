        <h1>Introduction to Django and Its History</h1>
        
        <h2>What is Django?</h2>
        <p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.</p>

                <li>Provides an optional administrative interface</li>
                <li>Emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components</li>

        <p>The framework was named after the jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt.</p>
